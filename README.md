#### [What is Advent of Code(AoC)?](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)
From its site: 

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

For me, it's a way to try out new technologies; for example picking up new languages like [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).


Or a way to approach common problems in a totally different manner; for example using functional programming to solve problems or implementing solutions more efficiently by utilizing SIMD instructions or parallelism.
