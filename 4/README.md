``` sh
$ nim r aoc4.nim

Not using regex because Nim's regex is too slow.

Alternatively, one could use a parser like [pegs](https://nim-lang.org/docs/pegs.html) or [Npeg](https://github.com/zevv/npeg) (like [zevv's day 4 AOC solution](https://github.com/zevv/aoc2020/blob/master/04/main.nim)). Kudos to [zevv](https://github.com/zevv/)!
